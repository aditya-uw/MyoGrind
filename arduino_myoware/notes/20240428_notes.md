# Week (Sunday 4/28 - Saturday 5/4)
- Sunday, April 28:
    - ER created timing-mechanism branch that introduces framework for time recording an event
    - ER added code that defines data structure and writes data to a csv file locally on Arduino microSD card (adapter needed)
    - ER ordered microSD card adapter from Amazon
    - Data Storage and Handling:
        - Data Recording: Each sensor reading is recorded continuously and stored line-by-line in a CSV file (data.csv) with headers EventNumber, Timestamp, and SensorValue.
        - File Management: The data is stored on an SD card connected to the Arduino. Each new line in the file represents a sensor reading captured every 0.1 second during an event.
        - Event Tracking: Events are tracked by monitoring the sensor values. An event starts when the sensor value rises above 300 and is considered to have ended when the value does not exceed 300 for a continuous duration of one second.
    - Future Database Notes:
        - Database Name: BruxismEMGData
        - Table Name: sensor_readings
        - Columns:
            1. EventNumber
                - Type: Integer
                - Description: A unique identifier for each bruxism event. An event starts when the sensor value exceeds 300 and ends when the value stays below 300 for more than one second. This number increments with each new event.
                - Example: 1, 2, 3, ...
            2. Timestamp
                - Type: Timestamp
                - Description: The exact time at which a sensor reading was taken, measured in milliseconds since the Arduino started. This value helps in tracking when each specific reading occurred during an event.
                - Example: 1250, 1350, 1450, ...
            3. SensorValue
                - Type: Integer
                - Description: The value read from the EMG sensor. It reflects the muscle activity level at the time specified by the timestamp.
                - Example: 350, 360, 320, ...
